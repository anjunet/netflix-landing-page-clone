## Overview

The Netflix Landing Page Clone recreates the structure and style of Netflix's homepage. 
It includes a navigation bar with the Netflix logo and a sign-in button, a background section with a dark overlay, a video playing over an image, and a footer with multiple columns of links and a language dropdown menu. 
This clone demonstrates layout techniques such as z-index, positioning, and hover effects to achieve an elegant design.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Positioned at the top of the page, the navigation bar includes the Netflix logo on the left and a "Sign In" button on the right.
- **Background Section**: A background image covers 70% of the screen and has a dark overlay for a cinematic effect.
- **Television section**: In this section a video plays on loop over the background image od a television set, achieved using the CSS position property and z-index to stack the elements correctly.
-- **Footer Section**: The footer contains several footer items (links) arranged in 4 columns, providing a clean, structured layout. Footer links have hover effects to enhance user interaction. A language dropdown menu is included for user convenience.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: For structuring the webpage and defining elements like the navigation bar, background section, and footer.
CSS3: For styling, including layout (using the position property and z-index for video and image layering), hover effects, and responsive design.
